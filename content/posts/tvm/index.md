title: "[VLDB 2024] TVM: A Tile-based Video Management Framework"
draft: false
date: 2023-11-17
description: "With the exponential growth of video data, there is a pressing need for efficient video analysis technology. This study introduces a novel tile-based video management framework, called TVM, which leverages the semantic information embedded in videos, without being dependent on specific query workloads. By constructing a tile-based semantic index for newly ingested videos, TVM effectively reduces the size of decoded and processed video data."
