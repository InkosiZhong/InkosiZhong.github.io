title: "[Arxiv] Preprocessing Enhanced Image Compression for Machine Vision"
draft: false
date: 2022-07-10
description: "In this work, we propose a preprocessing enhanced image compression method for machine vision tasks to address this challenge. Instead of relying on the learned image codecs for end-to-end optimization, our framework is built upon the traditional non-differential codecs."
