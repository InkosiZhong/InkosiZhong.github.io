title: "[ChinaMM 2022] A Transformer based deep conditional video compression"
draft: false
date: 2022-05-05
description: "It is difficult to attain the best compression performance given that typical CNN can only use local correlations and the sparsity of prediction residual. This paper proposed a Transformer-based deep conditional video compression algorithm, which can achieve better compression performance."
