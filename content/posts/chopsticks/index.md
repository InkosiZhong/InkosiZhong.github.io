title: "Chopsticks: Sequential Task Manager for Linux and MacOS"
draft: false
date: 2023-05-03
description: "I often run complex computing jobs on a single node. When I am ready to leave, and the submitted task has not yet finished, I still wanna append new tasks so that it has done more work when I come back. Therefore I build a task manager similar to SLURM, but in a serial execution style."
