title: "[CVPR 2022] Learning Based Multi-Modality Image and Video Compression"
draft: false
date: 2022-03-20
description: "Multi-modality (i.e., multi-sensor) data is widely used in various vision tasks for more accurate or robust perception. This work proposes a multi-modality compression framework for infrared and visible image pairs by exploiting the cross-modality redundancy."
