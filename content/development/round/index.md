### Modern Design
rOund is a modern design style running route planning app. 
With the assistance of Amap's local and cloud services, users can plan a movement route with a closed starting point and ending point. 
The product idea comes from the rigid mileage requirements of the campus sports app. 
Users sometimes hope that the end of the exercise will return to or be close to their starting point, thereby saving unnecessary return expenses; or maybe they are tired of repeating the boring experience on the playground every day. 
Now with the help of rOund, users can easily plan the shortest closed route that meets the mileage requirements.
rOund uses smooth animation to track the user's movement, record their movement information and give evaluation.
